## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I did my best to implement the delete request to work on my server.js file. It is very buggy. Also, I spent many hours trying to get my saved palettes to display on the DOM correctly but it is also very buggy.

My delete method isn't perfect, and I actually am not sure why it doesn't work as it should. 

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I spent many hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, but was unsuccessul in figuring it out.
